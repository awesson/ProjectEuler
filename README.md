# ProjectEuler
Visual C# code used for solving <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives">ProjectEuler</a> problems.

For the most part, it contains a function which, given specific arguments, solves a particular Euler problem. However it's also meant to build up a library of misc mathematical functions, ideally sharing as much code as possible when solving different problems.
